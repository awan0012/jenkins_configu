Download the Jenkins package for your operating system from the Jenkins website (https://jenkins.io/download/).

Install the package by following the instructions for your operating system. This may involve running commands such as apt-get install jenkins or yum install jenkins.

Start the Jenkins service by running the command systemctl start jenkins on Linux or jenkins.exe start on Windows.

Verify that Jenkins is running by visiting http://your_server_ip:8080 in a web browser. You should see the Jenkins dashboard.

Configure the Jenkins service to start automatically when the server is rebooted by running the command systemctl enable jenkins on Linux or jenkins.exe install on Windows.

To configure Jenkins to run on a different port, edit the file /etc/default/jenkins on Linux or C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\jenkins.xml on Windows and change the value of the HTTP_PORT variable.

For security reasons, it's recommended to run Jenkins behind a reverse proxy or use a Jenkins Security Plugin.
