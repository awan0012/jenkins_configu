In the pipeline configuration, set up a trigger to automatically build the pipeline when code is committed to the repository. This can be done by using the "Poll SCM" trigger, which periodically checks the repository for new commits, or by setting up a webhook in the repository that triggers a build when code is committed.

In the pipeline script, define the build, test and deployment steps for the pipeline. These steps can include tasks such as compiling code, running unit tests, packaging the application, and deploying it to a test or production environment.

Use Jenkins plugins to integrate external tools such as code coverage, static analysis, test automation frameworks, etc.

For deployments, use Jenkins plugins like Deploy Plugin, Blue Ocean or Jenkins Pipeline Deployment Plugin to deploy the code to different environments.

In the pipeline script, you can also add conditions or stages that determine whether or not to proceed with the deployment based on the test results or code reviews.

To trigger the pipeline after a pull request, you can use Jenkins plugins such as GitHub Pull Request Builder or GitLab Pull Request Builder.

If you are using code review tools like Gerrit, you can use Jenkins plugin Gerrit Trigger to trigger the pipeline when a change is submitted for review.

Note that these are the general steps, the specific steps can vary depending on the tools, resources and environments you are using.
