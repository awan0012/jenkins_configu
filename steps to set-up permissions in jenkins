In the Jenkins dashboard, click on the "Manage Jenkins" button and then select "Configure Global Security".

In the "Authorization" section, select the security realm you want to use, such as "Jenkins' own user database" or "LDAP".

In the "Authorization" section, select the authorization strategy you want to use. The most common strategy is "Matrix-based security", which allows you to specify permissions for specific users and groups.

In the "Matrix-based security" section, you can add users and groups and assign them specific permissions. For example, you can give the "admin" group permission to "Run Scripts" and "Configure Jobs".

In the "Project-based Matrix Authorization" you can assign permission for a specific job or pipeline. This way you can restrict permission to a specific pipeline or job.

To enable permissions for a specific plugin, go to the "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" and find the plugin you want to enable, click on the plugin and enable the permission.

Once you have set up the permissions, save the changes and test them by logging in as different users and attempting to perform actions that should be restricted.
